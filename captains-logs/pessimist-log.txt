Existential dread for breakfast again.
If a ship explodes in orbit and nobody is within a few hundred light years...does it make a sound?
It is so quiet.  So so so so quiet. So so so so so so so so so so so so so so
Cannot remember the sound of laughter.
Would spend every resource for an hour of fresh air.
Hope fleeting.  Terror on-hand.
Hard to imagine ever making it back home.
Space has no philosophy. No morality. No empathy.
Just.............a lot of quiet moments.
Thinking of objects as friends. Talking to my food.
Paranoia around every corner. Keep sensing someone else in the ship always just out of view.
Daily routine of brushing teeth and combing hair only thing keeping me from madness.
