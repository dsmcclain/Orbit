Existential dread for breakfast again.
It is so quiet.  So so so so quiet. So so so so so so so so so so queit.
Cannot remember the sound of laughter.
Would spend every resource for an hour of fresh air.
Hope fleeting.  Terror on-hand.
Hard to imagine ever making it back home.
Space has no philosophy.
Just.............a lot of quiet moments.
Thinking of objects as friends. Seeing someone else in the ship, always just out of view.
